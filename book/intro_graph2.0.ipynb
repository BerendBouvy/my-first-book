    "\n",
    "A time series is a sequence of data points indexed in time in order to study a phenomenon. It is thus the data collected at different points in time. The data are usually collected at fixed time intervals rather than just recording them intermittently or randomly. The fixed interval, in the time domain, is defined as 'sampling interval' and, in the frequency domain, is defined as 'sampling rate' or 'sampling frequency', expressed for example in Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is denoted as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(t) = [Y(t_1), Y(t_2), \\ldots{}, Y(t_m)]^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $Y(t_i)$ are random variables, since the data is affected by noise.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$Y(t) = tr(t) + s(t) + o(t) + b(t) + N(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we distinguish the following components:\n",

    "1. $tr(t)$ = trend, provides the general behavior and variation of the process\n",
    "2. $s(t)$ = seasonality, shows the regular seasonal variations\n",

    "5. $N(t)$ = noise, can be white or colored noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend\n",

    "We address here two types of trend analysis.:\n",
    "Different types of trend are possible for now we will mainly focus on linear trend, i.e. The time-dependent variable $Y(t)$ changes at a (constant) linear rate over time: $Y_t = y_0 + r t + \\epsilon_t$. Other trends are however also possible, for example, quadratic or log linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal variations explain regular fluctuations in a certain period of time (e.g. a year), usually caused by climate and weather conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall), cycles of seasons, customs, traditional habits, weekends, or holidays. For example, the weekly signal is usually evident in the volume of people engaged in shopping (likely more people prefer going shopping in the weekends)\n",
    "\n",
    "From {numref}`trend` it is also possible to see the seasonal variations: in fact sea levels are higher in summer and lower in winter. The annual warming/cooling cycle is the main contributor to these seasonal variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular seasonal variations in a time series might be handled by using a sinusoidal model with one or more sinusoids whose frequency may be known or unknown depending on the context. A harmonic model for seasonal variation can be of the following two equivalent forms (using that $\\cos(u+v)= \\cos u \\cos v - \\sin u \\sin v$):\n",

    "Noise simply refers to random fluctuations in the time series about its typical pattern. In general we can talk about white and colored noise in time series analysis. The following characteristics are associated with noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Noise is not necessarily synonymous to error, but part of noise is the random error.\n",
    "- It is required to filter out unwanted random variations, and detect meaningful information (i.e., a signal) from noise processes.\n",
    "- Transforming data from the time domain to the frequency domain allows to filter out the frequencies that pollute the data.\n",
    "- White noise can be decomposed into its constituent components (frequencies) like white light.  In principle, white noise contains all wavelengths/colors, each contributing equally to the fluctuations observed in the data.\n",
    "- Colored noise can seriously affect the analysis of time series, and their parameters of interest. Short-term colored noise has also predictive property (used for forecasting).\n",
